# Marketwise News

News bot which detects major shifts in prediction markets.

To define some terms here:
Polymarket, Metaculus, Manifold, etc are "platforms".
A "market" is a single question, which is resolved on its own, on a platform.
Markets can be binary or multi-choice.
However, multi-choice might also be a "market group" if parts resolve separately.
